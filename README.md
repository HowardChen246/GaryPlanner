The project for CSE 110.

We will use docker to ease the process of developmenet and deploying. Here are some links that might be useful:
- Docker Doc: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
- Docker-compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/

We will use PostgreSQL as our database, you can find it here: https://www.postgresql.org/

When developing database model and controllers (APIs), you should be finding these following link useful as we are using flask-sqlalchemy and blueprints. 
- Flask-Sqlalchemy: https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/
- Flask Blueprints: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/views/

In order to process data, I used selenium and bs4. I will also list the link here:
