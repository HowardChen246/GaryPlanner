Hi, this is the code for front-end of the gary planner. We will be using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) with [Next](https://nextjs.org) as the framework.

## Tutorial

It is highly recommended to complete (or read through and understand) the following tutorial before procedding:
- [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#declaring-a-winner): We did a lab in React, so that should be sufficient as well.
- [Next Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app): I did the first three parts ("Create a Next.js App" to "Assets, Metadata, and CSS"). These three should be enough to get you started.

## Getting Started

First of all, make sure you have the environment setup correctly. 

If you *don’t have Node.js installed*, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/). You’ll need Node.js version 10.13 or later. 
If you have Node.js installed, you can check your Node.js version using `node -v`. If it is an *older version*, you can upgrade your Node.js using the command
```bash
sudo n latest
```
You’ll be using your own text editor and terminal app for this tutorial. (I highly recommend VSCode. It's just easy -- X)


Second, install all the modules needed. Go to `/front-end/` and do:
```bash
npm install
```
This should install everything needed.

Now, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The entry point of the website is `index.js`. I wrote a simple page as a placeholder. You can try to understand it after you finish the NEXT tutorial. --X
